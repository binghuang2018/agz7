# agz7
Amons with up to 7 heavy atoms for GDB7 and ZINC

# Notes
- Each amon is accompanied with only one conformer
- Each conformer corresponds to the lowest energy configuration, among all other local minimas.
- The lowest energy conformers were determined through force-field (MMFF94)
- Reported final geometry (see sdf files) were calculated at the level of theory DF-B3LYP by Molpro
  - default geometry convergence thresholds were used
  - basis: cc-pVTZ-PP for Sn/I, cc-pVTZ for all others
  - df basis: def2-QZVPP/jkfit for Sn/I, cc-pVQZ/jkfit for all others
