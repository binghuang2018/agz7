# agz7
Amons with up to 7 heavy atoms for GDB7 and ZINC

# Notes
- Each amon is accompanied with only one conformer
- Each conformer corresponds to the lowest energy configuration, among all other local minimas.
- The lowest energy conformers were determined through force-field (MMFF94)
- Reported final geometry (see sdf files) were calculated at the level of theory DF-B3LYP/cc-PVTZ by Molpro
  - default geometry convergence thresholds were used
  - df basis: for Sn/Se/I, def2-QZVP/jkfit; for all others, cc-pVQZ/jkfit
